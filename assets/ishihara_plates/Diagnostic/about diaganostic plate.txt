Diagnostic Plate:
Purpose: To detect red–green color vision deficiency.
Normal color vision: Sees the correct number.
Color vision deficient: Sees an incorrect number or cannot see the number.
Diagnosis instruction: If multiple diagnostic plates are read incorrectly, red–green color vision deficiency is suspected.
Used to diagnose: Protanopia, protanomaly, deuteranopia, deuteranomaly.
Diagnostic value: Yes.




Protanopia:
Description: Complete absence of red cone photoreceptors.
User recognition: Fails to see red-based numbers or sees them as a different number.
Typical response: Cannot identify the number or gives a wrong answer.
Diagnosis rule: Consistent failure on plates designed for red perception indicates protanopia.

Protanomaly:
Description: Reduced sensitivity to red light.
User recognition: Sees the number faintly or confuses it with a similar digit.
Typical response: Incorrect or uncertain answers on some plates.
Diagnosis rule: Partial errors on red–green diagnostic plates indicate protanomaly.

Deuteranopia:
Description: Complete absence of green cone photoreceptors.
User recognition: Green-based numbers are not perceived correctly.
Typical response: Wrong number or no number seen.
Diagnosis rule: Repeated errors on green-sensitive plates indicate deuteranopia.

Deuteranomaly:
Description: Reduced sensitivity to green light.
User recognition: Difficulty distinguishing green from red shades.
Typical response: Occasional incorrect answers.
Diagnosis rule: Mixed correct and incorrect responses on green–red plates indicate deuteranomaly.
